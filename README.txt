Included:
-the paper
-MovieLens benchmarking data file (MovieLens 100k)
-c++ implementation code

In branch vcl I have a vectorized version using Agner Fog's vector class library (https://www.agner.org/optimize/#vectorclass). Unzip to this projects code directory, add the vector class folder to include path, and compile with g++ -O3 -std=c++17 -I./version2-2.01.04 newmain.cpp -o newmain (or with whatever version you downloaded)
